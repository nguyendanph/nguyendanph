ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Dan Nguyen. 
I've been interested in web and app development since I developed a local online marketplace called "Mythdoor" with my older brother in college. That website allows me to see how I can create products that will be valuable to someone. This helped me solidify my decision to pursue a bachelor's degree in software engineering and begin delving more into the realm of software engineering.

I've been loving working with Javascript frameworks like React and Python frameworks (Django) on the backend to create full-stack applications. However, I am still eager to learn more and go further into the worlds of infrastructure, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and so on. I am currently looking for a full-stackÂ web development role, ideally in writingÂ Python and Javascript. If your company is searching for employees, let's talk!
